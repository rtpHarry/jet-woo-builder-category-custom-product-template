# Usage
Install the plugin and activate it.

Go to WooCommerce Products > Categories and you will find new options to
select a Jet Woo Builder single product template to apply to all products
in that category.

Use the Priority field if you have products in multiple categories and 
need to decide which template should take priority.

Note: If you set a custom template on the individual product page then that
will override the category level template selection.
